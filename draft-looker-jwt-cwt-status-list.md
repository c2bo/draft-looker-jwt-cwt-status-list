# Introduction

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) {{RFC7519}} and CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) {{RFC8392}} as secure token formats, have vast possible applications. Some of these applications can involve issuing a token whereby certain semantics about the token can change over time which are important to be able to communicate to relying parties in an interoperable manner, such as whether the token is considered revoked by its issuer.

This document defines a status list using JWT and CWT for representation that is capable of communicating the individual statuses of multiple tokens. The document also defines how an issuer of a token references a status list in a JWT or CWT which has a status to convey.

The following diagram depicts the basic conceptual relationship.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# JSON Web Token Representation

## JWT Format and Processing Requirements {#jwt-format-and-processing}

The following rules apply to validating a JWT which references a status list. Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the discretion of the verifying party.

1. The JWT MUST contain an "iss" (issuer) claim that contains a unique string based identifier for the entity that issued the JWT. In the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise, compliant applications MUST compare issuer values using the Simple String Comparison method defined in Section 6.2.1 of {{RFC3986}}. The value MUST be equal to that of the "iss" claim contained within the referenced status list JWT.

2. The JWT MUST contain an "status" (status) claim conforming to the rules outlined in [](#jwt-status-claim-format)

The following example is the decoded header and payload of a JWT meeting the processing rules as defined above.

~~~ ascii-art

{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "kid": "11"
}
.
{
  "iss": "https://example.com",
  "status": {
    "typ": "revocation-list",
    "idx": 0,
    "uri": "https://example.com/statuslists/1"
  }
}

### Status Claim Format {#jwt-status-claim-format}

The following rules apply to validating the "status" (status) claim

1. The claim value MUST be a valid JSON object.

2. The claim value object MUST contain a "typ" (type) attribute with a string based value that represents the type of status list referenced. The value MUST be equal to that of the "typ" attribute in the "status_list" claim for the referenced status list.

3. The claim value object MUST contain an "idx" (index) attribute with a numberic based value that represents the index to check for status information in the status list for the current JWT. The value of this attribute MUST be a non-negative number, containing a value of zero or greater. Refer to xx for details on the validation procedure.

4. The claim value object MUST contain a "uri" attribute with a string based value that identifies the status list containing the status information for the JWT. The value of this attribute MUST be a uri conforming to {{RFC3986}}

## Status List JWT Format and Processing Requirements {#jwt-status-list-format-and-processing}

The following rules apply to validating a JWT based status list. Application of additional restrictions and policy are at the discretion of the verifying party.

1. The JWT MUST contain an "iss" (issuer) claim that contains a unique string based identifier for the entity that issued the JWT. In the absence of an application profile specifying otherwise, compliant applications MUST compare issuer values using the Simple String Comparison method defined in Section 6.2.1 of {{RFC3986}}. The value MUST be equal to that of the "iss" claim contained within the JWT who's status is being verified.

2. The JWT MUST contain an "iat" (issued at) claim that identifies the time at which it was issued.

2. The JWT MUST contain an "status_list" (status list) claim conforming to the rules outlined in [](#jwt-status-list-claim-format).

3. The JWT MAY contain an "exp" (expiration time) claim that convey's when it is considered expired by its issuer.

4. The JWT MAY contain other claims.

5. The JWT MUST be digitally signed using an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Relying parties MUST reject the JWT if it is using a Message Authentication Code (MAC) based algorithm. Relying parties MUST reject JWTs with an invalid signature.

6. Relying parties MUST reject a JWT that is not valid in all other respects per "JSON Web Token (JWT)" {{RFC7519}}.

    "lst": "H4sIAAAAAAAAA-3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQwfoAA......IC3AYbSVKsAQAAA"
  }
}

### Status List Claim Format {#jwt-status-list-claim-format}

The following rules apply to validating the "status_list" (status list) claim

1. The claim value MUST be a valid JSON object.

2. The claim value object MUST contain a "typ" (type) attribute with a string based value that represents the type of status list referenced. The value MUST be equal to that of the "typ" attribute in the "status" claim for the token who's status is being validated.

3. The claim value object MUST contain a "lst" (list) attribute with a string based value that represents the status values for all the tokens it conveys statuses for. The value MUST be a base64 encoded string using RFCXXX containing a GZIP compressed octet string {{RFC1952}}.

## Revocation Status List Definition

This document formally defines the "revocation-list" status list type which applies the following additional validation rules beyond those described in [](#jwt-format-and-processing) and [](#jwt-status-list-format-and-processing).

The "uri" attribute contained within a JWT using the "status" claim MUST be an HTTPS based URL that when resolved via an HTTPS GET request returns a content type "application/jwt" containing the status list.

# Security Considerations

## Correct decoding and parsing of the encoded status list
TODO elaborate on risks of incorrect parsing/decoding leading to erroneuos status data

## Cached and Stale status lists
TODO consumers/Verifiers of the status list should be aware if they fetch the up-to-date data

## Authorized access to the Status List
If the status list token is provided without any kind of access restriction (allowing everyone to resolve and process the status list), there are some privacy considerations that need to be taken into account (discussed in detail in [](#privacy-considerations)):

- Verifiers are able to re-check the validity of previously provided tokens without consent of the holder.
- Third parties are able to do profiling by periodically checking the contents of the status list.

While this might be wanted behavior depending on the use-case, this should be taken into the consideration when using the status list. Access to the status list can be restricted. There are three general approaches for status list regarding authorization:

- no authentication: the status list can be retrieved and by all involved parties without any kind of restriction.

- verifier authentication: the status list is retrieved by the verifier after successful authentication - this expects some form of verifier authentication to exist. This especially makes sense if verifier authentication is part of holder/verifier interactions and should be strongly considered in that case. This does not prevent re-checks from the verifier but at least excludes untrusted third parties from profiling.

- holder authentication: instead of the status list getting retrieved by the verifier, the holder retrieves the status list (possibly re-using the authorization mechanism that was used for the token issuance) and provides it additionally to the token during a presentation. The verifier could still pool status list presentations from different holders and extract additional information but has no direct access to the status list.

Restricted access to the status list token can be achieved using well-known authorization mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 and should be considered.

## History
TODO elaborate on status list only providing the up-to date/latest status, no historical data, may be provided by the underlying hosting architecture

# Privacy Considerations {#privacy-considerations}

## Herd Privacy
TODO elaborate on herd privacy, size of the status list

## Profiling
TODO elaborate on Verifiers regularly fetching the status list to create a profile, possible countermeasures with authorized access to the status list

## Correlation Risks and Tracking
TODO elaborate on Issuer-Verifier correlation and Verifier-Verifier correlation as the status list introduces unique,trackable data
TODO elaborate on issuers avoiding sequential usage of indices and status lists
TODO elaborate that a status list only gives information about the maximum number of possible statuses that a list conveys, issuers are recommended to pre-allocate lists, use dead entries that are never assigned or other obfuscation mechanisms

## Malicious Issuers
TODO elaborate on issuers generating unique status lists per JWT token that do not offer herd privacy

## Hosting Service (what's a better name here?)
TODO elaborate on increased privacy if the status list is hosted by a third party instead of the issuer reducing tracking possiblities
